# basic-neural-net
Basic C++ implementation of a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network employing the backpropagation delta rule.

## Getting Started
I haven't produced any documentation at this point, since I built this a while ago for my own personal projects. I've uploaded this for the benefit of others who might need a light and efficient C++ neural network implementation for their work.

One might improve this further by implementing other backpropagation techniques, such as an adaptive learning rate and inertia.
